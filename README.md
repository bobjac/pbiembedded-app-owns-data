PowerBI Embedded App Owns Data Sample
==================================

# Scenario
This repository contains sample code for an App Owns Data implementation for PowerBI Embedded.  The sample code is not meant for production use. It is explicit and imperitive with the intention of teaching rather than maintainability or production-level performance. In some cases, there are some harcoded values with code-comments so that the needed values or more easy to understand. In a real-world scenario, those values would be replaced by parameters.

# Tech Stack
For this sample, the following tech stack will be used.
* Authentication - Auth0
* Front End - React
* Backend - Java with JPA
* Data - Azure SQL Database

# Auth0 Setup
The frontend of this sample was origionally generated from the Auth0 sample project.  Detailed instructions for setting up you Auth0 instance so that it will work with this project can be found at [Auth0 Setup](web-portal/secured-frontend/README.md).
